 "Euclid is a European mission from ESA, with NASA collaboration. \n Euclid's main objective are about cosmology, namely constraining the dark matter and dark energy models.  To do so, it will observe billions of galaxies, both in imaging and spectroscopy, in order to perform weak lensing and galaxy clustering measurements.",
 'Instruments':{'VIS':"VISible Instrument (VIS): VIS is Euclid's main imager, looking at the visible light. With its good resolution and large field of view, it will probe galaxy shapes for weak lensing measurements but also galaxy morphology for galaxy evolution.",
                'NISP':"Near Infrared SpectroPhotometer (NISP): NISP is Euclid's instrument to measures galaxy redshifts. It will provide spectro-z and photo-z of most galaxies detected by VIS, with a grism and slitless spectroscopy. It's imager, with a slightly worse resolution than VIS, will also help galaxy morphology."},
  'Surveys':{'Wide':'Wide Survey: The Euclid Wide Survey will observe 25 000 square degrees (1/3 of the sky) with a depth of ~ 25.3.',
