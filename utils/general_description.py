 "**Euclid is a space telescope developed by the ESA, with NASA collaboration. \n The satellite will be at the L2 lagrangian point. \n Euclid's main objective are about cosmology, namely constraining the dark matter and dark energy models.  To do so, it will observe billions of galaxies, both in imaging and spectroscopy, in order to perform weak lensing and galaxy clustering measurements.**",
