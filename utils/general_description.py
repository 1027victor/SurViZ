 "Euclid is a space telescope developed by the ESA, with NASA collaboration. \n The satellite will be at the L2 lagrangian point. \n Euclid's main objective are about cosmology, namely constraining the dark matter and dark energy models.  To do so, it will observe billions of galaxies, both in imaging and spectroscopy, in order to perform weak lensing and galaxy clustering measurements.",
 'Instruments':{'VIS':"VISible Instrument (VIS): VIS is Euclid's main imager, looking at the visible light. With its good resolution and large field of view, it will probe galaxy shapes for weak lensing measurements but also galaxy morphology for galaxy evolution.",

It will provide spectro-z and photo-z of most galaxies detected by VIS, with a grism and slitless spectroscopy. It's imager, with a slightly worse resolution than VIS, will also help galaxy morphology."},
