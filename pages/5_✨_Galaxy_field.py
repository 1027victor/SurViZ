Visualisation of the survey depth

The fields are simulated using galsim, from a catalogue created with EGG.

For each galaxy, we convert the magnitude to the flux corresponding to the zero point magnitude of the instrument.
The galaxy (good pixel scale) is then convolved with the appropriate PSF
A background noise is added, corresponding to the exposure time of the survey

Note that for now, we do not simulate the fields on the fly, 
but just read the images previously simulated. Nevertheless, 
the simulation is automatized in the same way than the other 
features of the app, but takes too much time to be done on the fly.

The user have to select the telescopes he want to display. For each selected telescope,
a new section will appear in the left panel, to chose the survey corresponding to the 
telescope. 
Note that for now, the band is fixed, selected with the "main_band" info ot the instrument

The pixel scale information is stored in the instruments file (/telescopes/instruments.py)
The PSF and pixel scale information are stored in the instrument's band file (/telescopes/instruments.py)
The noise level is stored in the surveys file (/telescopes/surveys.py)

For each selection, the dictionary info from /telescopes/main_info is read.
The structure is as follow. To read Euclid's NIR's zero point:
     - info['Euclid']["Instruments"]['Euclid_NIR']["bands"][main_band]['zp']

The galaxy simulation procedure are done in sim_field(...) and sim_and_save_fields(...) in /utils/diverse_utils
The plotting is done by plot_fields in /utils/plot_galaxies.py
