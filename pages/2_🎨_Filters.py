"""
Visualisation of the filters
The user have to select the telescopes he want to display. For each selected telescope,
a new section will appear in the left panel, to chose the instrument corresponding to the 
telescope. 

The filters information are stored in the instruments file (/telescopes/instruments.py)
For each selection, the dictionary info from /telescopes/main_info is read.
The structure is as follow. To read Euclid's NIR's Y band, we read:
     - info['Euclid']["Instruments"]['Euclid_NIR']["bands"][Y]

By default, when selecting an instrument, all bands are displayed, but you can then remove some.
For some, you can also restrict to a survey, become some surveys do not use the whole range of the instrument's filters

The plotting is done by plot_bands in /utils/plot.py
