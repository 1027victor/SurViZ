"""
Visualisation of the image qualities on a galaxy.

The galaxy is an Illustris-TNG galaxy (https://www.tng-project.org/data/)

We first degrade the resolution to the expected pixel scale
The galaxy is then convolved with a PSF modelled as a gaussian with the expected instrument's FWHM

Note that for now, we do not simulate the galaxies on the fly, 
but just read the images previously simulated. Nevertheless, 
the galaxy simulation is automatized in the same way than the other 
features of the app, but takes too much time to be done on the fly.

The user have to select the telescopes he want to display. For each selected telescope,
a new section will appear in the left panel, to chose the survey corresponding to the 
telescope. 
Note that for now, the band is fixed, selected with the "main_band" info ot the instrument

The pixel scale information is stored in the instruments file (/telescopes/instruments.py)
The PSF information is stored in the instrument's band file (/telescopes/instruments.py)

For each selection, the dictionary info from /telescopes/main_info is read.
The structure is as follow. To read Euclid's NIR's pixel scale
     - info['Euclid']["Instruments"]['Euclid_NIR']["pix_scale"]

The galaxy simulation procedure is done in create_and_save_gal(...) in /utils/diverse_utils
The plotting is done by plot_galaxies in /utils/plot_galaxies.py
